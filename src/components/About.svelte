    I‘m a 16 year old self-taught Front-End Developer based in Germany. My
    interest in web development started back in 2017, I tried <br /> to develop
    a website out of curiosity after seeing my brother doing it. Ever since,
    I’ve been loving it. <br /> <br /> When I’m not doing anything coding related,
    I’m a high schooler who enjoys graphic designing, video editing and working out.
